This essay will focus on forms of data analytics, mainly classification methods. It will give particular focus to regression, classification trees and clustering. This essay will give more of a focus on how they were developed and their uses more so than the mathematics they are based on. 

The two regression models that will be discussed are logistic (binrary not multinominal) and linear regression.  Regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables.

Cluster analysis is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).

Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model which maps observations about an item to conclusions about the item's target value

The logistic function was developed in the 19th century for the description of the growth of populations and the course of autocatalytic chemical reactions. The original model was an adequate model for unopposed population growth in a young country such as United States. However, the Belgian astronomer turned statistician Alphonse Quetelet correctly hypothesized that the indiscriminate extrapolation of exponential growth must lead to impossible values. He experimented with several adjustments to the original model and instructed his student Pierre-Francois Verhulst to do likewise. He was also the first to make real progress to the logistic regression and logistic function in use today. It was he who coined the term logistic function and developed the original form of the logistic function:

f(t)=  e^t/(e^t+1)  =1/(1+e^(-t) )
