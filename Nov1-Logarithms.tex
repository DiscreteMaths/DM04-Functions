\[ 2^3 =8 \]
\[ \mbox{Log}_2 8 = 3 \]




The logarithm of the product of two positive numbers is the sum of the logarithms of the numbers
\[ \mbox{Log}(A\times B) =  \mbox{Log}A +  \mbox{Log}B \]

For example
\[ \mbox{Log}_2(32) =  \mbox{Log}_2 4 +  \mbox{Log}_2 8 \]

\[ \mbox{Log}_{10}(10000) =  \mbox{Log}_{10}(10) +  \mbox{Log}_{10}(1000) \]


The logarithm of the quotient of two positive numbers is the logarithm of the numerator minus the logarithm of the 
denominator.

\[ \mbox{Log}( {A \over B} ) =  \mbox{Log}A -  \mbox{Log}B \]

For example
\[ \mbox{Log}_2(4) =  \mbox{Log}_2 32 -  \mbox{Log}_2 8 \]

\[ \mbox{Log}_{10}(100) =  \mbox{Log}_{10}(10000) -  \mbox{Log}_{10}(100) \]


The logarithm of the $n-$th power of a positive number is the product of n and the logarithm of positive number.

\[ \mbox{Log}A^n =  n\times \mbox{Log}A  \]

For example
\[ \mbox{Log}_2(4^3) =  3 \times \mbox{Log}_2 4 \]

\[ \mbox{Log}_5 \sqrt{625} =  \mbox{Log}625^{0.5} =  0.5 \times \mbox{Log} 625 \]
