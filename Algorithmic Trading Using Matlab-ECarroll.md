## Algorithmic Trading with Matlab

MATLAB is a high-performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming in an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in familiar mathematical notation.  Matlab was originally written by Cleve Moler, chairman of the computer science department at the University of New Mexico in 1970â€™s, to provide easy access to matrix software developed by the LINPACK and EISPACK for his students. Recognizing its commercial potential Jack Little, an engineer from Stamford, joined Moler to develop the language and interface into what it is today.
