# Kitman Labs

# Background
Kitman Labs was founded in November 2012 and is a sports science technology company with offices in the US and Ireland. The company was 
founded by Stephen Smith, former Senior Strength & Conditioning/Rehabilitation Coach at Leinster Rugby. The foundation of the company was 
Smith's Master's research, which focused on combined risk factors as predictors of athletic injury. Kitman Labs partners with elite and 
professional sports organisations around the world to enable teams to prevent the risk of injury and increase player availability.

# The System
Their unique Athlete Optimization System was developed by their rich team of sports and data scientists and practitioners. Athlete OSTM 
is a cloud-based software system that works on any device connected to the Internet. It is used to help teams reduce the risk of injury 
while optimizing their data to make informed decisions. The Athlete OSTM system comprises of three parts
* Workload assessment
* Motion capture
* The Profiler system.

# Workload Assessment
Elite athletes spend their days training, practicing or competing. Each of these activities is intense and puts a great deal of stress on 
the body, which the athlete needs time to recover from. If there's too much work and/or not enough recovery, the athlete will break down 
and get hurt. The Kitman Labs system tracks activity based on coach input or third-party data sources to fully understand how much each 
athlete is working. It identifies peaks in training workload, tracks fatigue and allows coaches and trainers to adjust so their athletes 
don't do too much. The system also factors in how athletes are feeling and  what they do outside the training/playing environment. 
Athletes answer questionnaires on their smartphones covering their sleep, mood, stress and soreness. Based on this comprehensive 
assessment, coaches can pay particular attention to athletes whom the system identifies as at risk of injury.

# Motion Capture
Kitman Labs has a patent-pending motion capture technology that enables fast and accurate biomechanical screenings, allowing coaches to 
assess their athletes in minutes rather than hours. The data from the tests performed by this technology is impressive. The system 
produces an extremely detailed wireframe model of a person, indicating each and every joint. One of the most impressive aspects of this 
technology is when an athlete jumps, the system can determine if the athlete produces slightly less force with one leg rather than the 
other. This would indicate a slight imbalance, which, if left unaddressed, could result in an injury—extremely powerful data for a coach. 
Also, since athletes can move through the tests quickly, they can go through a pre-workout screen that identifies any potential issues 
that could cause a problem that specific day.

# Profiler System
The Profiler System compiles the data from the workload assessment and motion capture. If the algorithms identify an athlete at risk, the 
system alerts the coach so he or she knows the athlete needs special attention. If an athlete is at extreme risk, the coach is notified 
to get ahead of a potential injury. The key here is proactive. Elite and professional sports organisations are very good at reacting to 
injuries. If an athlete tears an ACL, doctors and physical therapists can get that athlete back on the field in less than a year. But 
what if they could prevent that injury from happening in the first place? The information generated by the Kitman Labs system allows 
coaches and medical staffs to get in front of many injuries. So far, the results have been promising.

# Clients
Initial customers are comprised of professional level rugby teams, such as the four Irish provinces, Grenoble, Bath and Sale, and Premier 
League soccer teams, such as Everton and Norwich City. Kitman Labs have also added NFL team Miami Dolphins and NBA team Detroit Pistons 
to their ever expanding client list. Kitman Labs report that they have reduced their clients injury profiles by 30-32 percent. For NFL, 
NBA and other professional sports teams that use the system, more players were available to play, improving their seasons and each team's 
odds of winning. It is estimated that it costs US sports teams $500 million in salaries for players who are forced to miss games through 
injury. To reduce their clients injury profiles by 30-32 percent, represents a massive saving to Kitman Labs clients.

# Future Goals
The challenge for Kitman Labs? Growing beyond professional sports. They state that they see a system like theirs as a benefit to all 
athletes. Believing that if there's an opportunity to reduce injuries, it needs to be explored. But while currently lower-level coaches 
and athletes may not have the resources to acquire and use such a comprehensive system, founder Stephen Smith believes that a time will 
come when they will and that the future for Kitman Labs is that they'll be the gold standard platform across all sports.
