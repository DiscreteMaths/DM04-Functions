Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4} and Y={A,B,C,D}. Determine whether each relation is a function, with X -> Y.
(a) f = {(2, C), (1, D), (2, A), (3,B), (4, D)}

No:  Two different ordered pairs (2, C) and (2, A) in f have the same number 2 as their first coordinate

Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Determine whether the following relation on X is a function.

(b) g = {(3, A), (4, B), (1, C)}

No The element 2 does not appear as the first coordinate in any ordered pair in g.
